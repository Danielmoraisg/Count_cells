# Count_cells
Fast ai based project to count cells from microscopy images

## Objective
The aim of this project is to facilitate life of those researcher who have to spend hours counting cells on a microscope

## How??
To achieve this objective a machine learning algorithm is going to do all the hard work for yourself. The algorithm is a pytorch/Fastai python script that enables a resnet archtecture to learn how to count cells in an image
